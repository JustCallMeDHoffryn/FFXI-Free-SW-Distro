"All In 1 Place" is a visualisation tool that disaplays a variety of "useful" information for players of FFXI, specifically for the NS private server.

The DB of information is a "work in progress" and will be updated now and again as I find more things that I don't understand that would benefit from a picture.

To get the best from this application you should use the /FINDALL plugin, the manual provided explains how to configure access to the plugin.
