This app allows you to view the inventory and storage of your main character and up to 3 alt/mules.

Each list is independent, the char can be selected via the buttons at the bottom and the storage location can be selected using the buttons at the top of the list.

Before you start, make sure that you have FINDALL installed and edit the setting.xfg file to let the app know where your data is stored and the names of your characters.

In each list, if the item is shown in green it also exists in another character. If it is in red you have a duplicate in the inventory of the current character.

Please report bugs and suggestions.
